# desktop-wallpaper-changer
A script to change the desktop wallpaper. This was made for Windows 10, but can be used with any OS with a slight change.
It uses Bing's wallpaper of the day as the image source.
You can use Windows Scheduler or any other scheduler to allow this script to change the wallpaper regularly.
